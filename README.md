# ATTINY85 Sequencer form factor

Started out as one of a specialized layouts for a Eurorack, but became a more generic version.

For the most part, this is a two PCB ATTINY based circuit that focuses on the following 3 in/2 out


1 POT input
1 CV input
1 Clock ( although it could be another CV)
1 Gate/Trigger out 5V
1 pwm + lpf out


[Turning style sequncer](https://github.com/robstave/ArduinoComponentSketches/tree/master/ACS-85%20ATTiny85%20sketches/ACS-85-0630)  This is what I made the form factor for. Turning style one knob sequencer with 3,4,5,6,8,inf sequences.  Use CV to change a value.  It requires a clock.

I have two of these set up.  You put in a clock and get one of many patterns ( triangle, saw, sine, random, square).
The CV just kinda gooses the freq to 2x, 3x,4x
